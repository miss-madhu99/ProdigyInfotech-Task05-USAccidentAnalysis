# 🚦 Task-05: US Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship** with **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The goal is to analyze **US accident data** to identify patterns based on road conditions, weather, time of day, and locations. Visualizations help reveal accident hotspots and contributing factors.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Load and clean US accident dataset  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to find hidden patterns  
- Visualize accident frequency based on:
  - **Weather conditions**
  - **Time of day**
  - **Day of the week**
  - **Road type**
  - **City/State-level heatmaps**

---

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Plotly / Folium** (for geospatial visualization)

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Converted date/time columns  
- Filtered required columns (severity, weather, city, etc.)

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Most accident-prone **cities and states**  
- Time-based distribution (morning, evening, night)  
- Accident trends based on **weather** (fog, rain, clear)  
- Day-wise and month-wise patterns

### 3️⃣ Visualization
- **Bar plots**, **line graphs**, and **heatmaps**  
- **Folium map** for accident hotspots  
- **Pie chart** for accident severity

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Majority of accidents occurred during **peak traffic hours** (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM)  
- States like **California, Florida, and Texas** had the highest accident rates  
- Most accidents happened during **clear weather** — human error may be a key factor  
- Road surface and lighting conditions influenced severity
